# Microsoft Stock LSTM Prediction

This GitHub repository contains an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model for predicting the stock prices of Microsoft Corporation. The goal of this project is to forecast future price movements based on historical data.

## Features

- Historical stock price data: The repository includes a dataset with Microsoft's stock price history, including date, opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and trading volume.
- LSTM model implementation: The core of the repository is an LSTM neural network implemented in Python. It utilizes past stock price data to predict future price movements.
- Data preprocessing: Code is provided to preprocess the historical stock price data, including normalization and splitting into training and testing sets.
- Model training and evaluation: The LSTM model is trained using the training data and evaluated using the testing data. The repository includes code for both training the model and evaluating its performance using relevant metrics.
- Prediction visualization: The repository provides code to visualize the predicted stock price movements alongside the actual stock price data, facilitating a comparison between the model's predictions and real-world values.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Preprocess the dataset by running the data preprocessing script.
4. Train the LSTM model by executing the provided training script.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using the testing data.
6. Utilize the trained model to make predictions for future stock price movements.
7. Visualize the predicted and actual stock price data using the provided visualization script.

## Dependencies

The repository requires the following dependencies:

- Python (3.6 or above)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
